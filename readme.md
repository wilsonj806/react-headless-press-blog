# React Headless Wordpress Blog
## Overview
This is a quick gardening blog that'll be built with React for the frontend and headless Wordpress as the CMS. Since it's a blog, we're going to need to add content, so that's where Wordpress comes in. App deployment will be done in AWS at the end and there'll be some form of automated testing and deployments done.

## Basic Requirements
Here are the basic requirements for this project:
- it needs to use React for the front end
- it needs to use Wordpress as the CMS
- the final app needs to be on Amazon Web Services

Not much to it, but there's a lot of room to grow this in complexity.
